1 We have an autocracy which runs this university. It's managed.
2 We asked the following: if President Kerr actually tried to get something more
3 liberal out of the Regents in his telephone conversation, why didn't he make
4 some public statement to that effect? And the answer we received -- from a
5 well-meaning liberal -- was the following: He said, "Would you ever imagine
6 the manager of a firm making a statement publicly in opposition to his board
7 of directors?" That's the answer! Now, I ask you to consider: if this is a
8 firm, and if the Board of Regents are the board of directors, and if President
9 Kerr in fact is the manager, then I'll tell you something: the faculty are a
10 bunch of employees, and we're the raw material! But we're a bunch of raw
11 material[s] that don't mean to have any process upon us, don't mean to be made
12 into any product, don't mean to end up being bought by some clients of the
13 University, be they the government, be they industry, be they organized labor,
14 be they anyone! We're human beings!

16 There is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so
17 sick at heart, that you can't take part; you can't even passively take part,
18 and you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the
19 levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop. And you've got
20 to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless
21 you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all!
