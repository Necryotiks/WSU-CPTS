#THIS WAS TERRIBLE
#IGNORE ALL LOWERCASE TEXT
#MAX AND I WORKED FOR 8 DAMN HOURS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THESE DAMN FUNCTIONS
#I WAS SO SALTY, I COULD SALT AN ENTIRE BAG OF LAYS POTATO CHIPS
#THIS WAS THE HARDEST HOMEWORK YET
#TEARS OF BLOOD WERE SHED
#I DIED ON THE INSIDE
#WE SHOULD GO OVER FUNCTIONS MORE
#
#This homework was easy
#This was even easier than homework three and four. I can't really talk about this project.
#This programming assignment went welll. It was pretty easy, 
#I dont have much to say in the topic. other than google was an invaluable asset.
# This excerpt for the first assignment sums up how it went:
#All and all this was not too difficult as I only ran into two problems:
#Keeping track of parenthesis and using proper operands.
#Thank god for friendship and Google (Thank You Casey Hunter).
#This was a  low difficulty project.
#Well these are my thoughts on this assignment
#Didnt shed tears of blood this time.
# Not gonna lie, the reflection essay is the hardest part.
#It was worth.
#I thoughtthat the process was mostly straight-forward.
#Was pretty easy. 
#I am running out of things to say about this.      
#learned many things out of this project
#such as how to use sleep commands and while loops 
#I feel pretty goodd about this assignment.
