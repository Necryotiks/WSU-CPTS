This project was ok. I was not to difficult. With help of the internet I was able to finish this project.One struggle i overcame was calling varibles in functions. I used the global command to allivate the call before definition problem. Onne problem i was unable to over come was finding characters without spaces. I could only find the number of space characters. One piece of advice to future student: stackoverflow.com is your friend. The most fun aspect of this program was finishing it. Most challenging aspect of this was dealing with the functions.Nothing was really hard to understand as i had access to the internet. The assingment was alright, i cant think of anything to think of.
