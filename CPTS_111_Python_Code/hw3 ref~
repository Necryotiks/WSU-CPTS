#This programming assignment went welll. It was pretty easy, 
#I dont have much to say in the topic. other than google was an invaluable asset.
# This excerpt for the first assignment sums up how it went:
#All and all this was not too difficult as I only ran into two problems:
#Keeping track of parenthesis and using proper operands.
#Thank god for friendship and Google (Thank You Casey Hunter).
#This was a moderate difficulty project.
#Well these are my thoughts on this assignment
#Didnt shed tears of blood this time.
# Not gonna lie, the reflection essay is the hardest part.
#It was worth.
